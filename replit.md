# Digital Letter Collection Application

## Overview

This is a React-based digital letter collection application that creates an intimate, personal experience for reading and managing heartfelt letters from loved ones. The application features a warm, nostalgic design with smooth animations and accessibility features, allowing users to browse through a collection of letters, read them in a dedicated reader interface, and manage favorites. Built with modern web technologies including React, TypeScript, Express.js, and PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool and development server.

**UI Components**: Utilizes shadcn/ui component library built on top of Radix UI primitives for accessibility and consistency. Components follow the "new-york" style variant with custom theming.

**Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming. Implements a warm, nostalgic color palette with fonts including Playfair Display for headings, Source Serif Pro for body text, and Inter for UI elements.

**State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query) for server state management with custom query client configuration. Local state managed with React hooks.

**Routing**: Uses Wouter for lightweight client-side routing instead of React Router.

**Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth page transitions and interactive animations throughout the application.

**Accessibility**: Comprehensive accessibility features including font size adjustment, high contrast mode, keyboard navigation, and ARIA labels. Audio feedback system with Web Audio API for enhanced user experience.

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript running on Node.js. Uses ES modules throughout the codebase.

**API Design**: RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on letters, following conventional HTTP methods and status codes.

**Request/Response Handling**: Express middleware for JSON parsing, URL encoding, request logging with timing information, and comprehensive error handling.

**Development Integration**: Custom Vite integration for development with middleware mode, HMR support, and static file serving in production.

### Data Storage Solutions

**Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling via Neon Database serverless driver for production scalability.

**ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations and schema management. Includes Zod integration for runtime validation.

**Schema**: Letters table with fields for title, author, content, preview, date, image URL, and favorite status. Uses UUID primary keys generated by PostgreSQL.

**Development Storage**: In-memory storage implementation for development and testing with sample data initialization.

**Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for database schema migrations and management.

### Authentication and Authorization

Currently uses session-based storage infrastructure but authentication is not actively implemented. The storage interface includes user management methods (getUser, getUserByUsername, createUser) indicating planned user authentication features.

### External Dependencies

**Database**: Neon Database serverless PostgreSQL for production data persistence

**UI Framework**: Radix UI primitives for accessible component foundations

**Fonts**: Google Fonts integration (Playfair Display, Source Serif Pro, Inter, Geist Mono, Architects Daughter, DM Sans, Fira Code)

**Images**: Unsplash for sample letter images and welcome screen imagery

**Development Tools**: Replit-specific integrations including error overlay, cartographer plugin, and development banner

**Build Tools**: 
- Vite for frontend bundling and development
- esbuild for backend bundling in production
- PostCSS with Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript compiler for type checking

**Styling Dependencies**: Class Variance Authority for component variant management, clsx for conditional class names, Tailwind Merge for class conflict resolution

**Date Handling**: date-fns library for date formatting and manipulation

**Form Management**: React Hook Form with Hookform Resolvers for form validation (infrastructure present but not actively used)

**Session Management**: connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL session storage (configured but not actively used)
